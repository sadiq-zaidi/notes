										HTML Notes


Learning from youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE>


html is NOT a programming language, it is a Markup language

HTML tags are the basic building blocks of any webpage
<tagname>content</tagname>				tags comes in pairs with content in between
<h1></h1>						heading 1 tag
<p></p>							paragraph tag
<br>							self closing tag, they don't have any content in them

usually this is the structure


<!DOCTYPE html>						tells the browser in what language it is written in

<head>										
	<title>Page Title</title>			it has title, links to css files and javascript, metadata, keywords, page title is shown on the tab
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is a heading</h1>			Heading inside the body
	<p>paragraph</p>				paragraph inside the body    	
</body>
</html>


head + tab						it gives <head></head>

ctrl + U						it shows html code of a website in the browser

F12							it shows us the developers tools

<!--text-->						comments

there are 6 heading levels in html			h1 to h6, h1 being the biggest and h6 is the smallest <h1>heading 1</h1> ------ <h6>heading 1</h6>

lorem							lorem ipsum is the language to fill as paragraph
lorem100						write 100 words of lorem ipsum

<span>,<img>,<a>					inline elements, do not start a new line, take only necessary width
<div>,<h1> - <h6>,<p>,<form>				block line elements, start on a full line, take full available width

<strong>text</strong>					inline, text should be strong. By default it does bold

<em>text</em>						inline, emphasize. By default it shows italic

HTML Tags have attributes

<tagname						All tags have attributes, provide information about the element
attributename="attributevalue">content</tagname>		Placed within the start tag, Key/value pairs (id="some_id")
<h1 title="My Company">About Us</h1>

<a							Aey tag, url can be saved to be clicked, text is clickable link
href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">		href is an attribute, it tells where the location to open(local or url)
</a>							target _blank opens link in new tab
							

There are two types of lists ordered and unordered

<ul>							unordered list tag
	<li>bullet_points</li>				list items, default padding is also added
</ul>

<ol>							ordered list tag
	<li>bullet_points</li>				list items, default padding is also added, see in developer tools
</ol>


<table>							it displays table, it should only be used to add tabular data
	<thead>						table headings
		<tr>					table row
			<th></th>			heading element
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>						table body
		<tr>					table row
			<td></td>			table data
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


<form							we can format a form but cannot add functionality of the form,
action="process.php" method="POST">			submit the form in php file on server, it adds data to the database, secure then GET
							GET is ok for search bar or typing in the url
</form>
