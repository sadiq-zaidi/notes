										HTML Notes


Learning from youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE>


html is NOT a programming language, it is a Markup language

HTML tags are the basic building blocks of any webpage
<tagname>content</tagname>					tags comes in pairs with content in between
<h1></h1>							heading 1 tag
<p></p>								paragraph tag
<br>								self closing tag, they don't have any content in them

usually this is the structure


<!DOCTYPE html>							tells the browser in what language it is written in

<head>										
	<title>Page Title</title>				it has title, links to css files and javascript, metadata, keywords
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is a heading</h1>				Heading inside the body
	<p>paragraph</p>					paragraph inside the body    	
</body>
</html>


head + tab							it gives <head></head>

ctrl + U							it shows html code of a website in the browser

F12								it shows us the developers tools

<!--text-->							comments

there are 6 heading levels in html
