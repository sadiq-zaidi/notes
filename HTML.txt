										HTML Notes


Learning from youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE>


html is NOT a programming language, it is a Markup language

HTML tags are the basic building blocks of any webpage
<tagname>content</tagname>					tags comes in pairs with content in between
<h1></h1>							heading 1 tag
<p></p>								paragraph tag
<br>								self closing tag, they don't have any content in them

usually this is the structure


<!DOCTYPE html>							tells the browser in what language it is written in

<head>										
	<title>Page Title</title>				it has title, links to css files and javascript, metadata, keywords, page title is shown on the tab
</head>
<body>
	<h1>This is a heading</h1>				Heading inside the body
	<p>paragraph</p>					paragraph inside the body    	
</body>
</html>


head + tab							it gives <head></head>

ctrl + U							it shows html code of a website in the browser

F12								it shows us the developers tools

<!--text-->							comments
ctrl + k + c							keyboard shortcut for comment

there are 6 heading levels in html				h1 to h6, h1 being the biggest and h6 is the smallest <h1>heading 1</h1> ------ <h6>heading 1</h6>

lorem								lorem ipsum is the language to fill as paragraph
lorem100							write 100 words of lorem ipsum

<span>,<img>,<a>						inline elements, do not start a new line, take only necessary width
<div>,<h1> - <h6>,<p>,<form>					block line elements, start on a full line, take full available width

<strong>text</strong>						inline, text should be strong. By default it does bold

<em>text</em>							inline, emphasize. By default it shows italic

HTML Tags have attributes

<tagname							All tags have attributes, provide information about the element
attributename="attributevalue">content</tagname>			Placed within the start tag, Key/value pairs (id="some_id")
<h1 title="My Company">About Us</h1>

<a								Aey tag, url can be saved to be clicked, text is clickable link
href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">			href is an attribute, it tells where the location to open(local or url)
</a>								target _blank opens link in new tab
							

There are two types of lists ordered and unordered

<ul>								unordered list tag
	<li>bullet_points</li>					list items, default padding is added automatically
</ul>

<ol>								ordered list tag
	<li>bullet_points</li>					list items, default padding is also added, see in developer tools
</ol>


<table>								it displays table, it should only be used to add tabular data
	<thead>							table headings
		<tr>						table row
			<th></th>				heading element
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>							table body
		<tr>						table row
			<td></td>				table data
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


<form								we can format a form but cannot add functionality of the form,
action="process.php" method="POST">				submit the form in php file on server, it adds data to the database, secure then GET
								GET is ok for search bar or typing in the url
</form>

<br>								line break

<div>								block level element so they put in the next line
	<label>First Name</label>				label name which will be displayed as form name
	<input type="text" name="FirstName"			input have different attributes, text is common, name is for server side programming(process.php)
	placeholder="Enter your name">				grey out what is written and do not need to remove using backspace
</div>

<input type="email" name="Email">				email type validates if email is entered
<textarea name="Message"></textarea>				textarea is used to add large amount of text like message box

<label>Gender</label>						gender label of form
<select name="gender">						selection for gender initialized
	<option value="male">Male</option>			selectable option 'male', shown on page 'Male'
	<option value="female">Female</option>			selectable option 'female', shown on page 'Female'
</select>							select close

<label>Birthday</label>						Birthday label
<input type="date" name="Birthday"				callender can be opened for date selector

<label>Age</label>						Age label
<input type="number" name="Age"					input can be a number name is for server side programming
value="30">							value 30 is shown and can be changed by button

<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">		it submits to process.php, name is for server side programming, value is actual text on the button


<button click="SomeFunction">Click Me</button>			new button can also be made without form, follow function, click me written on the button


<a href="sample.jpg" target="_blank">				setting link if click on image in new tab
	<img src="sample.jpg" alt="My Sample Image" width="300">	image source is sample.jpg(in folder present), if image not found text shown, width 300, height is auto
</a>

<blockquote cite="google.com">					cite is where the quote comes from, it do not show site
	Lorem50
</blockquote>

<p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> is awesome</p>	wrap WWW in abbr tag which will show(title) abbreviation when cursor hover over it

<p><cite>HTML crash course</cite> is great</p>			cite tag gives italic style

<div style="margin-top: 500px;"></div>
